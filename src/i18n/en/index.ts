  NIKA_DESCRIPTION:
    'On 20 September 2022, 16-year-old Iranian teenager Nika Shakarami disappeared in Tehran during the 2022 Iranian protests following the death of Mahsa Amini. Her family was informed of her death ten days later. She had died under suspicious circumstances suspected to involve violence by security forces. After her body was identified by her family, they made arrangements to bury her in Khorramabad, but the body was allegedly stolen by Iranian authorities and instead buried in Hayat Ol Gheyb, reportedly to exercise leverage over her family and to avoid a funeral procession which could be the catalyst for further protests.',
